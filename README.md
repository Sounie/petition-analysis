Just a hobby project for looking into the data made available from petition site.

My curiosity started with the "[EU Referendum Rules triggering a 2nd EU Referendum](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/131215)" petition

After noticing some excitement in the media about the popularity of the petition I took a look into the data
and noticed that certain countries were highly over-represented in the signature counts - e.g. Vatican City had over
40,000 which exceeded the total population by a significant margin.

Since then the House of Commons Petitions Committee has [moved to address the more obvious invalid signatures](https://twitter.com/HoCpetitions/status/747063424132255745)
